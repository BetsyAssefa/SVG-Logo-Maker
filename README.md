## Description

The **SVG Logo Maker** is a command-line application that generates simple SVG logos based on user input. It allows users to create custom logos by choosing a shape, colors, and adding a short text, making it ideal for developers who want a quick and easy logo for their projects without needing to hire a graphic designer.

This project was built using **Node.js**, **Inquirer** for user input, and **Jest** for testing. Itâ€™s structured with an object-oriented approach, utilizing classes to define different shapes (Circle, Triangle, Square) with customizable colors.
